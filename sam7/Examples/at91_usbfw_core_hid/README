This was taken from a zip file called at91_usbfw_core101_hid100_gcc_20070310b.zip which
I think might have been an OpenPCD thing. In the lib directory there had been several
ARM versions in addition to the SAM7S64, but since that's the only one I'm working with
and I don't want a ton of cruft in my git repo, I rm'ed those.
