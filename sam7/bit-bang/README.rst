What is the BluetoothBitBang?
=============================

It's a piece of hardware comprising two boards from Sparkfun Electronics
(http://www.sparkfun.com), and some batteries, wiring, and test clips. Its
purpose is to allow you to write and read digital bits from your Android
phone. It has an associated Android app, for which the source code is at
../../android_apps/BluetoothBitBang/. There is a more complete description
of the entire project at http://bit.ly/bluetoothbitbang.
